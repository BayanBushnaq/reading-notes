## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
###  SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.

## Give a real world example.
### MySQL Community Edition
### MS-SQL Server Express Edition 
### Oracle Express Edition

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
### NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Give a real world example.
###  MongoDB
### CouchDB

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
### NOSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
### SQL

## What does SQL stand for?
### Structured Query Language

## What is a relational database?
### a collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
### A relational database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table.

## What is a 'schema'?
###  a list of logical structures of data

## What is a NoSQL database?
### originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational"

## How does it work?
### NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly,
### we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models.


## What is inside of a Mongo database?
### MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections.  

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
### NoSQL is a non-relational database, meaning it allows different structures than a SQL database (not rows and columns)
### and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
### NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions.
