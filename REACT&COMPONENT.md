### this topic teach me hoe to reduce Size and increase efficiency for my code. ###

### Component-Based Architecture ###

#### 1- What is a “component? ####
##### A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface , a software object, intended to interact with other components. #####

#### 2-What are the characteristics of a component? ####
- Reusability 
- Replaceable
- Not context specific
- Extensible
- Encapsulated
- Independent

#### 3-What are the advantages of using component-based architecture? ####
##### I general component has many advantages like : #####
##### Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components. #####

Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.
- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development 
- Reusable 
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independent

### What is Props and How to Use it in React ###

#### 1-What is “props” short for?  ####

##### A prop is an special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. #####

#### 2-How are props used in React?  ####

1. define an attribute and its value(data)
2. pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. render the Props Data

#### 3-What is the flow of props?  ####

##### Props can only be passed to components in one way (parent to child) #####

## SUMMARY ##
### The component is a capsulated function that can help me to customize my code and  use it any time I want and can I repeat using it in any different project. ###

### The props I think it's an object that organize the data transission between component ### 

## Things I want to know more about ##
1- what is the main diff between object and component.
