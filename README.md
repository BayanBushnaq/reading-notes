***I'm very intrested in Artificial inteligenc,machine learning and deep learning so I decided to diving in it by getting python course***
**This is a very famous Algo using machine learning**


 :green_circle:Linear regression.
 
 
 :purple_circle:Logistic regression.
 
 
 :black_circle:Decision tree.
 
 
 :brown_circle:SVM algorithm
 
 
 :large_blue_circle:Naive Bayes algorithm.
 
 
 :yellow_circle:KNN algorithm.
 
 
 :red_circle:K-means.
