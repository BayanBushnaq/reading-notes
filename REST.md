# How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?
#### American computer scientist,
####  one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
#### Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web,
 #### being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques 
####  developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.
 #### You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
#### HTTP

### What does a GET do?
#### For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

### What does a POST do?
#### If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

### What does PUT do?
#### If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT

### What does PATCH do?
#### do a partial update
