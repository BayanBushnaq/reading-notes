# Introduction Big O Notation : 
### **Big O Notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performence or complexity of an Algorithm.**
### **Big O specifically describe the worst case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an Algorithm.**



# Names and values in Python : 
### This talk about some fundamental concepts in Python: names and values.
### The mechanisms of Python are often quite simple, but their combined effects might not be what you expect. By understanding the mechanisms, you can reason about their effects.

### Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning Python recognizes the type of variable automatically. Therefore, the programmer does not need to define the data type when defining the variable

### Python variables are not what they seem. They do not hold values; instead, they hold references to objects. In Python, everything is an object, which means even the most basic data types like integers and strings are objects. It is different from other programming languages, where integers are standalone data types and not complex objects with associated properties and methods.


# How to Setup an Awesome Python Environment for Data Science or Anything Else

### It is talking about what environment you should install to use python in the best way, Sure it's depend on why you use it
### 1. The Interpreter
### For sure you could just simply download and install your favorite version of python and put everything into that
### Pyenv will help you doing that!
### It's including pypy, and anaconda.
### Finally type annotations are part of the standard library. Through type annotations, your code becomes better to understand, maintain, and less prone to errors. 
### You should use : mypy!
### Mypy is a static type checker for python code, that finds errors before they appear.

# Python 3 Module of the Week
## What are modules in Python?
### Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.

### A file containing Python code, for example: example.py, is called a module, and its module name would be example.

### We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.

### We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.

## What is Python 3 Module of the Week?
### is a series of articles written by Doug Hellmann to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python 3 standard library.



### It's include :
- Text 
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Dates and Times
- Mathematics
- The File System
- Data Persistence and Exchange
- Data Compression and Archiving
- Cryptography
- Concurrency with Processes, Threads, and Coroutines
- Networking
- The Internet
- Email
