# Test Driven Development (TDD)

### Test Driven Development (TDD) is a great approach for software development. TDD is nothing but the development of tests before adding a feature in code. This approach is based on the principle that we should write small codes rather than writing long codes. In TDD, whenever we want to add more functionality in our codes, we first have to write a test for that. After that, we add new functionality with small code lines combined and then test it with our test. This approach helps us to reduce the risk of encountering significant problems at the production level.

### Test Driven Development Process Cycle:
- First, add tests for the functionality.
- Next, we run our test to fail.
- Next, we write code according to the error   we  received.
- Then we run the tests again to see if the test fails or passes.
- Then refactor the code and follow the process again.


# What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
### Python files are called modules and they are identified by the .py file extension. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

### So when the interpreter runs a module, the __name__ variable will be set as  __main__ if the module that is being run is the main program.

### But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the __name__  variable will be set to that module’s name.

# What is Recursion?
### The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function

###  A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required. It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process. So we can say that every time the function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.

## Advantege of usung Recursion :
### Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write.
