# Software Design Patterns

## why design patterns exist?
###  Developers have noticed that they seemed to be approaching problems in similar ways in a bunch of different software’s, then they decided that it would be pretty useful to be able to talk about those approaches using a common vocabulary, so they wouldn’t have to keep explaining what they were referring to. 

### A design pattern : is only a description or template for how to solve a problem! that can be used in many different situations.

### There is 3 major types of design patterns:
- Creational Patterns: provide ways to instantiate single or groups of objects.
   - Factory Method. 
   - Singleton. .
   - Abstract Factory. 
- Structural Patterns: provide a manner to define relationships between classes or objects.
   - Facade.
   - Adapter.
   - Decorator.
- Behavioral Patterns: define manners of communication between classes and objects.
   - Observer.
   - Mediator.
   - Chain of Responsibility.


# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
### risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

## Why use Risk Analysis? 
### it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

## what could be the possible risks that you could encounter?
- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

## There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process.
 - Business Risks 
 - Testing Risks 
 - Premature Release Risk
 - Software Risks

 ## What is risk assesment?
 ### A risk assessment is a thorough look at your workplace to identify those things, situations, processes, etc. that may cause harm, particularly to people.

 ## The perspective of Risk Assessment

- Effect
- Cause
- Likelihood

## How to perform Risk Analysis?

- Searching the risk

- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

- Measures for the risk identified


# Dependency Injection :
## What is dependency injection ? 
### In object-oriented programming (OOP) software design, dependency injection (DI) is the process of supplying a resource that a given piece of code requires. The required resource, which is often a component of the application itself, is called a dependency.

## There are basically three types of dependency injection: 
- constructor injection.
- setter injection.
- interface injection.

## Benefits of using DI:
- Maintainability.
- Testability.
- Readability.
- Flexibility.
- Extensibility.
## Disadvantages of DI:
- It’s a bit complex to learn, and if overused can lead to management issues and other problems.
- Many compile time errors are pushed to run-time.

## Libraries and Frameworks that implement DI:
- Spring (Java).
- Google Guice (Java).
- Dagger (Java and Android).
- Castle Windsor (.NET).
- Unity(.NET).
