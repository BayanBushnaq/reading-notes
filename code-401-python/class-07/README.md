# What is Jupyter Lab?

### JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

# What is jupyter notebook?

### The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at Project Jupyter.

### JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks.


# Numpy Tutorial:

### NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. It is an open source project and you can use it.

### Operations using NumPy


- Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

- Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

- Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

## NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Matâˆ’plotlib (plotting library).

### Is NumPy an array?
## NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray . We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.

### Why is NumPy more efficient?
NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python's built-in sequences.
