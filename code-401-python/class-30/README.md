## What is a component-based architecture?

### Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions.

## What is the primary objective of component-based architecture?

### The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability. A component encapsulates functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit.

## What are the advantages of component-based software design over traditional object-oriented approaches?

### Component-based software design has many advantages over traditional object-oriented approaches, such as reduced time in market and development cost by reusing existing components, increased reliability with the reuse of existing components.

## What is a component?

### A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

## What are the different views of a component?

### A component can have three different views:
 -  object-oriented view : a component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes
 - conventional view : it is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing       logic, the internal data structures required to implement the processing logic, and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.
 - process-related view. : instead of creating each component from scratch, the system is built from existing components maintained in a library.


## What are the characteristics of components?

### Components are usually designed to be reusable in different situations in different applications. They may be freely substituted with other similar components, are designed to
