# Authentication

## What is authentication?

### Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device.


## What are the different types of authentication?

    -   Single-factor authentication (SFA) involves the use of a user ID and password.
    -     Two-factor authentication (2FA) involves the use of an additional factor, such as a unique code or biometric signature.
    -    Multifactor authentication (MFA) uses three or more factors for verification.


## Why is authentication important in cybersecurity?

### Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by only allowing authenticated users or processes access to protected resources.


## What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

  -  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or process before enabling access to protected networks and systems.
  -  Authorization is a more granular process that verifies that the authenticated user or process has permission to access a specific resource.


## How does authentication work?

  -  During authentication, the credentials provided by the user are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information.
  -  If the credentials match and the authenticated entity is authorized to use the resource, the user is granted access.
  -  User permissions determine which resources the user gains access to and any other access rights.
  -  Traditionally, authentication was done by the system or resource being accessed. Now, web application protocols can simplify user authentication by issuing a signed authentication token to the end-user application.
